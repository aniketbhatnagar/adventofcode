# adventofcode
Solutions to advent of code puzzles in scala.
====================================================================

Notes:
1. Uses (mostly) functional programming to solve puzzles
2. Uses Scala's parser combinators a lot
3. Have tried my best to reuse code between 2 parts of the same puzzle.
4. Contains basic test cases.
