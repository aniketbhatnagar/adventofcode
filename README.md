# Advent of code
## Solutions to advent of code puzzles in scala.

Notes:
- Uses (mostly) functional programming to solve puzzles.
- Uses Scala's parser combinators a lot for parsing inputs.
- Each puzzle solution is completely standalone and shares nothing with other puzzle solutions.
- Have tried my best to reuse code between 2 parts of the same puzzle (often resulting in refactoring after solving part 1).
- Contains basic test cases for each puzzle.
- Solutions contain no scala style errors/warnings.
